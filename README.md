Creating a repository for the tutorial
I created a Github account so I could learn my about the emerging crypto asset space. I'm interested in investing in ICOs and other projects that I think have a future in the cryptospace, and it would make sense that it'd help to understand a little bit about the way the open-source code is created and shared with the community.
